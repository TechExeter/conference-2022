						<p>For the past seven consequtive years, we’ve held Exeter’s only grass-roots tech conference, a sell-out event which attracts local and national speakers across a broad range of themes for our ever expanding tech & digital community.</p>
						<blockquote>“Tech Exeter and Digital Exeter are at the heart of the tech community in this beautiful city, where innovation is supported by leading incubators like SETsquared” - Tech Nation</blockquote>
						<blockquote>“My organisation (NHS Digital) and myself needs to be more involved in the TechExeter scene, I think it is really great to see this stuff going on.”</blockquote>
						<blockquote>“It's great that the Tech Exeter Conference has started from a grassroots level and is now a pull for developers from across the South West.”</blockquote>
