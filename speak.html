  <p>Our key word for this year's tech and digital conference is <strong>Community</strong>.
    We'd like to get your talks, workshops and panel sessions on anything to do with community building, servicing and supplying communities, and anything related to the tech+digital community.
  </p>

  <li>Returning speakers are welcome</li>
  <li>You can submit multiple talks</li>
  <li>Get paid £ to speak (see below)</li>
  <li>If you have a talk that isn't community focused - submit it anyway! We have 3 tracks of talks to fill, plus monthly meetups, so we need your submissions!</li>

  <h2>Am I techy enough? / I haven’t done this before …</h2>

  <p>Short answer: You are techy enough, and you can do this!</p>

  <p>Long answer:</p>

  <p>If you have a passion about a topic, whatever experience level, then we want to hear from you. <br/>
    If you haven’t done this before then we can help. We can review your slides, help with individual presentation styles and formats, and make sure you are fully prepared.
  </p>

  <h2>Get paid? What?!</h2>

  <p>That’s right – we value our speakers time and will pay for you to speak at this event!</p>

  <p>Everyone receives the same flat fee (the exact amount will be determined based on ticket sales and sponsorship monies raised) – you can spend this on travel / accomodation / whatever you want!</p>
