# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO

To enable content moderation on large social media platforms it is important to timely detect harmful viral content. The detection problem is difficult because content virality results from interactions between user interests, content characteristics, feed ranking, and community structure. 

This talk will shed the light on the design of the algorithms which can efficiently solve this problem at Meta scale.

<h3>Bio</h3>

I am a research scientist on the Facebook Research team, working on understanding and modelling large-scale user behaviour. 

Before joining Facebook I worked as a data scientist at Skyscanner and as a researcher at Kingâ€™s College London. My research interests lie on the intersection between systems design, data analysis and machine learning.
