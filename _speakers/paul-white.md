[ PLEASE AMEND TO BE FOCUSED AROUND WHAT THE TALK WILL BE ABOUT ]

Research of 3rd sector activity has exposed the existing of strong benevolent and caring communities, and that there is much being done to improve the social, economic, and ecological sustainability of our living and working in Devon.

 * 6,000 registered not-for-profit organisations, 33% - 2,153 social enterprise businesses, 67% 4,271 charities / voluntary community organisation.

 * 32,000+ employed by social enterprise, 42,000+ volunteering for charities / voluntary communities.

 * Total annual economic activity of £1bn plus (48% being social enterprise business activity, 51% charity / voluntary services overall, nearly 6% of the total economic output for Devon (measured at £17bn).

Critically however, lived experience of working with the sector confirms the greatest proportion of investment is prioritised to people services, ahead of digital investments. Whilst admirable and worthy it does however mean opportunities for technology aided efficiency and potential to do more with available resources are missed.

The fact is that despite the enormity this sector, operating alongside a sizeable public sector, there remains a significant deficit in the servicing of wellbeing needs, that because of Covid, is growing with increasing concern across a number of determinants of societal health and wellbeing.

For Devon the social and economic impact of this deficit easily exceeds £2bn of lost annual opportunity, this is an issue in every part of the UK, so nationally this becomes very significant.

The only way this lost opportunity can be recovered is if we can create greater efficiency and more capacity across the service sectors, and in this regard, there is great potential, in fact an imperative for the 3rd sector to have better access to not just technology, but resources with the skills and capabilities to ensure maximum benefit can be leveraged.

This is a call to action out to the to the tech community.
