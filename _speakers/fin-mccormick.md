# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

Founding a company is hard. Building an organisational culture is hard. Simultaneously building a company and a culture that fosters inclusivity and diversity is truly a challenge only for the bravest of entrepreneurs. 

Attempting to build an inclusive community around your company can be especially hard for entrepreneurs that don’t stereotypically come from underrepresented groups. Yet, building these inclusive cultures is vital in a world of tech talent wars, rapidly moving markets and highly competitive business landscapes.

In this talk I will share some of the tools and strategies developed at the Good Robot Company to ensure that the community we are building remains inclusive of people from any background.

<h3>Bio</h3>

I am currently a co-founder of The Good Robot Company, a cutting-edge AI/ML bias detection and analytics company. Through this start-up we are creating a community of organisations and individuals that understand that the future of AI needs to be a future of ethical AI. Creating an inclusive and diverse community is vital in developing this company. 

After a 6-year career in sales both in the UK and the Middle East. I started programming during my undergraduate Business degree at the University of Exeter’s Penryn campus. My final year dissertation was on algorithmic strategic decision making in the consulting industry and I quickly realised that there was an issue with bias in these programmes. 

Joining forces with a fellow Exeter student we are now building what, unsurprisingly, I feel is one of the most exciting tech start ups in the South West.
