I help run "Microsoft Artists", which is a Teams based channel helping keep people connected across all our xbox studios. I also run a global shared tools development ecosystem, and also run two working groups. 

These all tie together with a community / sharing theme so am sure there is something here I can speak to. Need to work out exactly what it could be. But I only found this website yesterday :)

<h3>Bio</h3>

From London, but grew up in Sidmouth. Joined Rare Ltd straight after my MSc. Moved to the US and lived there for 8 years. Back in Exeter now. Tech Art Lead on various projects over the last 14 years. 

Love making games and helping others make games. My role now is half supporting others and half R&D/incubation. Trying to also make a game in my free time. I have 3 kids so it's slow going :)
