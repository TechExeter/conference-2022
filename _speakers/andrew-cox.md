# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO

Creativity is, at its essence, an ideas business. A place full of inspiration, fun and community where there is no such thing as a bad idea and the only real limit is your way of thinking. 

The world is full of some fantastic creations that exist just because they can. Creativity can bring joy, and happiness and importantly bring people together. 

In my talk, I would like to run through the power of creativity on us individually, the people around us and how letting yourself get swept away with the sea of ideas can be such a wonderful thing. It's a positive talk with the intention to inspire people to get out there, get together and create!

<h3>Bio</h3>

Hello, I'm Andrew Cox I live in Bath and work in Bristol as the Head of Design and UX at a software development agency called Ghyston. I've also been running my own freelance design business for many years and have recently started my own clothing business. 

I've been in the design industry for over 10 years, working in various roles and sectors from print design, websites, marketing, illustration and anything creative I can get my hands on to be honest. Creating is my passion and I love getting the chance to get out and talk to people about it.
