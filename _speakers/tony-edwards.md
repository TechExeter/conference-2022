# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

What does a meetup loving software engineer do when our in-person communities disappear overnight?

This developer disconnected from the modern world and found a completely new community on his doorstep. One comprised entirely of birds. After spending 12 months feeding, recording, and identifying them, he now has the perfect dataset to get geeky and have some fun.

Bird song is a great example of the algorithmic properties of nature. Web Midi is the perfect way to express the algorithmic beauty of music in a digital-first world. But what happens when you mix the two together?

In his talk, Tony Edwards from Bluefruit Software aims to find out. Using the bird song recordings captured during lockdown series one & two as a starting point and with the help of his trusty MIDI controller, Tony will walk the Tech & Digital Exeter community through the creation of a few interactive demos.

Will they work? Probably. Will there be cat gifs? Definitely.
