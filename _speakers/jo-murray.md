takeaways:
 - An understanding of the power of new technology (from a completely non-technical speaker!)

# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO

I would be delighted to speak about my journey with the My Coast app and how I have learnt all about the power of new technology and space when it comes to innovative projects. 

We are developing a platform that will unite our communities with local Councils, utility companies, local businesses and our emergency services. The aim of the project is to connect the general public (both residents and visitors) and provide them with live safety advice and warnings, information on local services and facilities and give them a wealth of options of amenities, experiences and tourist attractions - all in one place. 

We are passionate about using local knowledge to make people's day to day lives safer and more enjoyable by giving them live information to enable better decision making.
