# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

With a little understanding, strategy, and empathy, any organisation or individual can use free platforms to create and foster community. Rebecca will bring in examples from her work with start-ups, co-operatives, and Safer Central Exeter to discuss what community can mean - and how you can help it grow - in an age of disconnection.

<h3>Bio</h3>

While studying part-time at the University of Exeter as a disabled student, Rebecca set up her freelance business with the aim of supporting herself sustainably. Nearly eight years on, she continues to enjoy working flexibly in social media management, training, bylined writing, and white-label work for agencies.

This year Rebecca became a full-time digital nomad. Since April she’s lived in Bristol, Penwith, Normandy, and Margate, with a coliving community in Tenerife on the cards for autumn/winter.
  
Rebecca is a Trustee of Devon Wildlife Trust and uses her experience to promote diversity in governance. She goes by Bex, never Becky, and - being from the North - will have extra gravy, please.
