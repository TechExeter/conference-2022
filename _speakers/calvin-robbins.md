# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

The value of building a community around early access to build better products by gathering feedback from engaged users.

Early Access features allow a small, closed group of participants the ability to try new functionality before it becomes more widely available. This provides an opportunity for Boomi to collect feedback from customers before finalising the feature for broader release.

Product launch was traditionally the end of the product development lifecycle: (1) concept (2) design (3) build (4) launch. Previously, early access is something that lived and died in stage 3 (build and test). In contrast, with the rise of agile development and continuous improvement, early access is more important than ever and can now be considered a process that not only occurs pre-launch, but also during the ongoing continuous improvement process prior to launching new features, design changes, or other product improvements.
