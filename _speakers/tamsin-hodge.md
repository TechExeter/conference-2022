# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

The marine environment is a fascinating place, used by the global shipping industry to transport goods all over the world and home to a diverse ecosystem of wildlife.

In this talk Tamsin will share insights on a new global initiative to make marine geospatial data more widely available to support future digital navigation and the protection of our ocean environment. 

The initiative is one she and the team at the UK Hydrographic Office are working on together in collaboration with local, national and global communities across the maritime industry.

Tamsin will share lessons learned from the work undertaken so far and show the potential that marine geospatial data offers.

<h3>Bio</h3>

My journey into a digital career has evolved from my love of science, nature, working with people and having an inquisitive mind keen to learn new things.

After leaving university with a degree in Biochemistry and an aspiration to move into scientific and technical writing I worked as a journalist and News Editor on weekly and daily newspapers in the South West region before stepping into marketing and product management in the commercial and public sectors.

I joined the UK Hydrographic Office  (UKHO) 15 years ago, working initially in the Corporate Communications team, and then expanding my tech and data skills to take on roles to develop and launch digital products and marine geospatial services used globally by mariners every day to sail safely around the world.

I am now leading on strategic engagement and relationship building with UKHO’s diverse regional, national and international maritime industry community partners to help us collaborate on initiatives to unlock the future of navigation together.

I value working in collaboration with others and encourage and embrace diversity.  I founded, and now lead, UKHO’s STEM Ambassador outreach programme to inspire young people into STEM careers, and am an active supporter of the Tech South West Community, to help shine the light on the great talent we have here in the region.

More details about my digital, technology and STEM journey are in this blog, which I was asked to write as part of a global campaign run by <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/geekyreality"  target="_blank">Geeky Girl Reality</a> to profile inspirational female role models working in STEM careers: <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/geekyreality/stemstories-tamsin-product-owner-uk" target="_blank">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/geekyreality/stemstories-tamsin-product-owner-uk</a>
