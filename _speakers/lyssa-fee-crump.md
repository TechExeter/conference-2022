Building a community around your brand generates massive growth. Weâ€™re talking 6,469% ROI according to the State of Community Management 2019 report. And no - thatâ€™s not a typo, it really does say six thousand four hundred and sixty-nine percent. Wowsers. 

So, weâ€™re all agreed? We need to create communities through our brands, but how? 
Through badass branding and authenticity. 

Itâ€™s one of the reasons Iâ€™m always trying to get people to #SayNoToVanilla - being brave with your brand and being authentic helps you develop rapport with your audience and build better relationships with your customers. 

And this isnâ€™t just true for B2C brands, itâ€™s equally true for B2B brands. Your tech company can build a community, filled with brand loyalty, trust, and badassery! 

Want to know more? Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve got you! 

In this session, weâ€™ll discuss:

    ðŸ¦‘ how having a distinct brand personality will help you build a better community 
    ðŸ¦‘ how to say no to vanilla
    ðŸ¦‘ why businesses fail at creating brand personality 
    ðŸ¦‘ why you should be brave with your brand
    ðŸ¦‘ weâ€™ll even do a quick exercise to help you understand who your current brand is 

and of course, Iâ€™ll share some examples of people who are totally nailing this concept.

<h3>Bio</h3>

Lyssa is a GIF-obsessed, massive nerd, and founder of Kraken Marketing. 

Sheâ€™s an award-winning marketing marketer who has been invited to speak at a number of international conferences where sheâ€™s known for her high-energy talks that heavily feature GIFs, memes and pop culture references. 

Lyssa doesnâ€™t do boring, stuffy talks, even when talking about important topics. Her slightly ridiculous sense of humour compels audiences to laugh as they learn. 

Sheâ€™s all about using Agile methodologies and data-driven marketing to drive real results. She wants to help you discover your authentic selves, to be brave with your brands - and say no to vanilla! 

Lyssa loves helping brands grow and develop by finding their niche and getting them in front of the right people. She lives, sleeps, and breaths a brand when she works with them - obsessive fangirl over here! She's may be based in Cornwall but she gets to work with global tech companies to help them level up. 

Lyssa has spent over a decade working with international brands, helping them grow and become more badass. 
She has been awarded Young Business Person of the Year, was one of Cornwallâ€™s 30 under 30, and was listed as one of 20 women leading the way in Cornwallâ€™s Tech Sector. Pretty cool, huh?

Whatâ€™s important to Lyssa?

    ðŸ¦‘ diversity, inclusivity, and accessibility
    ðŸ¦‘ using marketing & communications to create and nurture communities 
    ðŸ¦‘ helping tech companies communicate how awesome they are - in a way people care about 

Whatâ€™s Lyssa up to when sheâ€™s off the clock? 

Sheâ€™s a digital nomad, and can often be found road tripping around the country in her van. She also likes to cross-stitch swear words with pretty floral borders. If she has the patience and skill to stab a needle thousands of times to create art, she has the patience and skill to make your business a success.
