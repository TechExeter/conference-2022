# TALK DESCRIPTION IS BELOW, FOLLOWED BY BIO
---

Protected by the Great Firewall, China’s digital isolation in the early days of the internet era prompted the kinds of innovation not seen in the western tech world. Apps are different; business models are different; UX is different; even the fundamental role of tech in daily life is different.

With so much innovation happening in China, there is a lot we can learn. In his talk, David will dive deep into China tech covering the country’s most important apps as well as sharing insights covering mobility, climate tech and data regulation (it's interesting, honest!).
